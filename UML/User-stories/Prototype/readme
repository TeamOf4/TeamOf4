User stories for prototype build

Medical Staff

•	As a medical staff, I want to be able to register with a station so that I can receive an alert message on my phone when there is a problem with a patient. 
•	As a medical staff, I want the system to have all the separate modules so that I can be able to select which module is used to monitor the behaviour of a patient.
•	As a medical staff, I want to be able to de-register from the system when my call time expires.
•	As a medical staff, I want the system to trigger an alarm when patient requires my intervention.

Central Station

•	As an operator, I want to monitor all bedside systems in a bay, so that I can monitor an entire bay at once. (Make sure you can monitor all 8 bays at once).
•	As an operator, I want any bedside system that triggers an alarm to be clearly visible, so that it is clearly visible, so that it is visible at a glance.

Patient Monitor

•	As an administrator, I would like to display a numeric value which can be adjusted to suit different patients. 
•	As an administrator, I would like to select the modules used to monitor the behaviour of the patient to see the current readings of each module. 
•	As an administrator, I would like the bedside system to poll the modules periodically modules and display the readings. Of each of the module.
•	As an administrator, I would like the monitoring modules to detect a condition and trigger an alarm on the bedside system. To also inform the central with an appropriate message. 

I have completed the user stories for the Patient Monitor section of the requirements. 
Please could you add on the 2nd requirement Jack? The bit about the hardware modules and further development. 
I have also updated the board over at Trello. The user stories should all be complete.
