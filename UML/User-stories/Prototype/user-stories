User stories for prototype build

Medical Staff

•	As a nurse I need to be able to select which Patient results I am viewing so that I am viewing the correct one.
•	As a nurse I need to be able to set alarm limits so that if any of my patients go over the recomended limits I am aware.
•	As a nurse I need to be able to mute a patient alarm when I have seen to them, so that other nurses or doctors are aware it has been dealt with


Patient 

•	As a patient I need to be able to raise an alarm if I feel that my levels are going too high so that a nurse or doctor can be made aware.


I have completed the user stories for the Patient Monitor section of the requirements. 
Please could you add on the 2nd requirement Jack? The bit about the hardware modules and further development. 
I have also updated the board over at Trello. The user stories should all be complete.
